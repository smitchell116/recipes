Tuna Salad Recipe

Ingredients:

4 eggs
4-5 cans of tuna
mayonnaise
dill pickle relish
dill
seasoned salt (optional)

Steps:
1. Boil the eggs.
2. Remove the tuna from the cans and place in a large bowl. The number of tuna cans depends upon both the size of the cans and the number of people you'll be serving.
3. Once the eggs are boiled, peel off the shells, chop up the eggs, and add them to the bowl. Stir.
4. Gradually stir in spoonfuls of mayonnaise and pickle relish until the mixture is to your liking; similarly, sprinkle in dill and seasoned salt until it's to your liking.
5. Once everything is properly mixed, place the bowl in the refridgerator to chill for at least an hour, maybe more. You don't have to chill it, but it usually tastes better when chilled.
6. Serve tuna salad either in sandwiches or with crackers.
